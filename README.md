# ABOUT

During a one-week sprint, I coded and deployed a pixel art creator! The hackathon challenge was to create an interactive visual app that followed Mintbean's specified guidelines. To view the project, visit https://create-pixel-art.scarlett-spade.repl.co/. 

This was scoped as a solo hack. To follow my journey as frontend & blockchain developer, UI/UX designer, & film student: https://twitter.com/scarlett_spade
